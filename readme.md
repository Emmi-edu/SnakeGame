When the snake consumes the food, 
the player earns +10 points to their score.

providing ongoing opportunities for score accumulation.

To give the player a goal to achieve, an upgrade system is implemented,
which give power ups and power downs to spice up the game.

#### Leveling Up: 
Once players accumulate enough points, 
they will level up, triggering the display of the upgrade screen.

#### Selecting Upgrades:

while one intensify the hazards.

## Hazards
![gameover01.png](assets%2Freadme%2Fgameover01.png)
In **_Greedy Snake_**, hazards are included as obstacles keeping player from success.
Players must navigate various hazards that can lead to instant defeat. 

The key hazards include:

#### Boundaries
The edges of the game map serve as boundaries. 
Colliding with these walls results in immediate loss.

#### Fog of War
The map is enveloped in fog of war, 
obscuring visibility and preventing players from seeing hazards.
Players can only reveal tiles that they have explored,
adding an element of strategy to navigation.

#### Self-Collision
Players must avoid biting their own tail. 
If the snake collides with itself, 
it results in instant defeat.

#### Poison Gas

- **Spawn Locations:** 
Poison gas can appear randomly across the map.
- **Size Variation:** 
The size of the gas clouds varies based on the length of the snake.
- **Effects:** 
If the snake remains in the poison gas, it will lose length for each tick. 
If the snake's length is insufficient, this will lead to an instant kill.
- **Duration:** 
Poison gas clouds will dissipate over time, creating temporary hazards.

#### Enemy Snakes
<img src="assets/readme/enemy01.gif" width="50%"><br>
- **AI-Controlled:**
Enemy snakes are controlled by (basic) artificial intelligence and spawn from the boundaries of the map.
- **Competition for Food:** 
These snakes actively compete for food resources, adding to the game's challenge.
- **Hazardous Interaction:** 
Enemy snakes can also suffocate in poison gas. 
If a player crashes into an enemy snake, they will lose the game.
If an enemy snake crashes into the player, it will be defeated.
- **Death and Transformation:** 
When an enemy snake is defeated, 
it becomes food for other players, further intensifying competition.

Some upgrades can tune down or intensify the hazards, leading to more synergy.
Players must remain vigilant and strategic while navigating these hazards to survive and succeed in **_Greedy Snake_**.


## Language
**_Greedy Snake_** is written in C++ and CMake.
